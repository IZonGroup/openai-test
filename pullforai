 New York Times has a look at what we can all expect with regards to inflation in the coming year, also with a little bit of analysis of how wrong economists were last year. And so whether we should really be listening to economists estimates this time around, let's go and put this up on the screen. So they say, at this time last year, economists were predicting that inflation would swiftly fade in 2022 as supply chain issues cleared, consumers shifted from goods to services spending and pandemic relief waned. They are now forecasting the same thing for 2023, citing many of the same reasons. Specifically, they say that last year, economists surveyed by Bloomberg, expected so-called core inflation to fall to 2.5% by the end of 2022. Instead, it is currently running at about 5%, twice that pace. This year, forecasters expect inflation to fade to 3% by the end of 2023. So they added in, I guess, a little bit more humility in terms of their lower inflation predictions, but still are predicting that inflation is going to ease. Look, I think it's one of these where we have no idea. And we should all be humbled by that. You know, one of the reasons that inflation could get a lot worse is because China ends COVID-0 and their demand goes way up, which means that all of our domestic gas prices go sky high. So that could have nothing to do with the war in Ukraine. It could have nothing to do with that. It would probably, frankly, be better for the people of China. It would be way worse for us. There could be some sort of another horrific lockdown in China. And then inflation could get much better here. Or it could be the opposite where they lock down the Foxconn facilities and all that. And we have supply chain problems all over again. What's the universal theme? No clue. We could have a deal in Ukraine and that could make everything much better. We could have a passive escalation. That could make everything much worse. Way worse. We could have a big government bailout bail, some sort of thing which could possibly juice demand and some sort of deal on the tile tax credit, which may increase inflation or we may not get one at all. That's the point. No clue about what exactly is going to happen. Or something could happen that none of us has even thought about or contemplated or floated whatsoever that could gum up the supply chains all over again. I think it's this article where part of what has led to inflation remaining high even as the Fed has taken extraordinary action is that corporations just continue escalating prices because they realize they can get away with it. And so you've had continue to have huge corporate profits and that's part of what has made it so difficult to tackle inflation. Ultimately, it looks like the Fed is going to continue their hawkish policy at least somewhat into the future, not that it has really had all that much of an impact on inflation thus far because it's not ultimately getting at the real root causes of inflation. So anyway, very hard to project what the next year is ultimately going to bring. There were some recent numbers that seemed to show inflation was easing. You see some numbers from Europe that also show maybe inflation is easing. You certainly see gas prices have come down. What you're paying at the pump has come down. That's a key component as well. Rent prices apparently have also eased and part of the expectation of why economists think that inflation will fall is because think about it. If your rent prices go down, it takes a while for people to move into different apartments and to begin having those rent payments really show up in terms of inflation going down. So that takes a while to get into being reflected in the numbers. So they think that that's going to happen in the future. But ultimately, it's a whole lot of guessing games. We don't know uncertainty about the future, especially when you have a massive war going on and very unpredictable actions in China. Also, in the way that we react to this is totally wonky and crazy. Like, inflation goes down to only 7%, and then the market goes up by 800 points. So you're like, well, hold on. The 7% is still bad. So what does that even mean? Like, what are our actual expectations are going to be? I think is we got no clue. I personally, brace for the worst, just in case. Hope for the best. Yeah. Prepare for the worst. That'll be our mantra for 2023. There you go. All right. Love you guys. See you soon. Hey, guys. Ready or not? 2024 is fully upon us now.
